# canva-design-tutorial
In this video, I walk you through the step-by-step process of how I designed this project using the techniques taught in the tutorial:

I followed the video closely, learning how to:

Set up the canvas and workspace

Use shapes, layers, and alignment tools effectively

Apply color schemes and typography for a clean, modern look

Add final touches and export the design in high resolution

This project reflects my dedication to learning and applying new design skills. I'm currently applying for a free internship in graphic design to grow further, gain industry experience, and contribute creatively to a professional environment.

Thank you for watching!
